    * This will be a general place for team members to put code snippets or paste pictures of progress and more general items that don't belong directly on this document.
* We are using a Facebook Group chat to communicate


## Coding Guidelines
* 4 spaces in place of a tab (can be configured through Geany)
* Comments before each method and wherever possible
* Using underscores (`_`) in variable and method names (e.g. `my_method()`, `my_var`)
* Constants will be in 'UPPER_CASE'
* Opening curly brace will be on the same line as the method/statement declaration (i.e.)
```c
int main() {
    if(true) {
        print("true");
    } else {
        print("false");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
